# CyberSec Warfare — Simulate. Automate. Outperform.

> **"While others study platforms like ProcessUnity, I reverse-engineer and rebuild them — from ingestion to escalation. No license. No enterprise access. Just raw architecture, full-stack infrastructure, and real results."**

## Built For:

- [ProcessUnity](https://www.processunity.com/third-party-risk-management/) – Vendor Risk & GRC Modeling
- [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) – Real-Time Log Ingestion, Alerting, and Dashboards
- [SOAR](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/solutions/solution-areas/security-orchestration.html) – Threat Response Automation
- [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) – Executive Reporting, Live Risk Metrics, and Supplier Trend Analytics

## Project Summary

CyberSec Warfare is a full-stack, AI-powered third-party risk and vulnerability management lab — purpose-built to mirror the exact workflows performed in ProcessUnity and similar enterprise-grade security platforms.

This lab was designed, built, and tested end-to-end **in under 3 days** to prove one thing:

**You don't need access to expensive software to master it. You just need passion, resourcefulness, and execution.**

## Key Components

| Module | What It Simulates |
|--------|-------------------|
| **AI CVE + Vendor Generator** | Builds realistic vendors, contact details, risk metadata, SLA gaps, and duplicate records |
| **SQL Server on Red Hat** | Mirrors enterprise risk data architecture and backend enrichment storage |
| **Excel Analytics Layer** | Performs reconciliation, enrichment, and validation using XLOOKUPs and Excel workflows |
| **Splunk Integration** | Ingests JSON threat logs, enriches live dashboards, and fires alerts based on key conditions |
| **SOAR Integration** | Simulates automated actions and email playbooks using tagged risk criteria |
| **Power BI Dashboards** | Executive-level views of sector exposure, CVSS trends, MTTR outliers, and geographic threats |
| **Outreach Simulation** | Generates realistic vendor communication workflows based on exposure and SLA policies |

---

## Why It Matters

- **Simulates Real Risk Analyst Duties:** Data ingestion, SLA monitoring, outreach coordination, reporting.
- **Trains Real Analyst Judgment:** Designed missing data fields, false positives, and corrupt uploads to mirror vendor cleanup work.
- **Extensible & Realistic:** Built on live environments (Red Hat, Ubuntu, SQL Server) with auto-ingesting pipelines.
- **Built With Speed, Vision, and Precision:** Completed in just days, but modeled after years of cybersecurity knowledge.

## My Mission

> I don’t build for attention — I build for **real understanding**.

While I may not have 2–3 years of corporate experience, I’ve invested **5+ years of passion-fueled cybersecurity building** — crafting real environments, reverse-engineering platforms, and automating what others still do manually.

**CyberSec Warfare** is my commitment to making world-class cybersecurity systems **trainable, repeatable, and accessible** — especially for those who don’t have enterprise credentials or vendor licenses.

> I don’t just want a job.  
> I want to **help build the future of cybersecurity** — from the ground up.
