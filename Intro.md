# CyberSec Warfare – Project Overview

### What This Is  
This project is a fully automated, AI-enhanced simulation of a real-world **Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)** and **Vulnerability Intelligence** workflow — designed to mirror how enterprise platforms like **ProcessUnity**, **Splunk**, **Power BI**, and **Excel** are used together in modern cybersecurity operations.

### what we are gonna get into

- **CVE Ingestion** – Automatically generates & enriches CVEs with realistic metadata  
- **Vendor Analysis** – Tracks SLA gaps, exposure windows, and response status  
- **Excel Reconciliation** – Handles field matching, XLOOKUPs, and data validation  
- **Power BI & Splunk** – Dashboards and alerts for real-time and executive insights  
- **AI Engine** – Central logic automating risk flow decisions and trend detection

### Why It Matters  
This lab replicates an **enterprise-grade cybersecurity process** using only self-built tools and open-source logic. It shows how complex risk operations can be made **trainable, repeatable, and accessible** — even without paid licenses or cloud infrastructure.

### Built By  
An analyst with 5+ years of hands-on cybersecurity building experience, reverse-engineering real platforms to create a ground-up, AI-powered simulation that proves mastery through execution — not just theory.
