# CyberSec Warfare – Project Overview

![CyberSec Warfare Overview](https://github.com/dylanleonard-1/Mission-statement-/blob/main/8E6467E0-E3F9-4F2D-A4E3-D1ABDF078C52.jpeg)

## What This Is  
A fully automated, AI-enhanced simulation of **Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)** and **Vulnerability Intelligence** workflows. Designed to mirror how enterprise platforms like **ProcessUnity**, **Splunk**, **Power BI**, and **Excel** function — built from scratch using modular tools, custom pipelines, and live dashboards.

## Walkthrough Breakdown

| Section | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [1. Python Logic](./sections/Python_Logic.md) | Overview of CVE generation, AI enrichment, automation, and record injection |
| [2. CSV Pipeline](./sections/CSV_Generation.md) | How CSV injects are created, structured, and passed to ingestion pipelines |
| [3. Data Pipeline Map](./sections/Data_Pipelines.md) | Full visual and functional breakdown of how each component connects |
| [4. Excel Workflows](./sections/Excel_Integration.md) | Live XLOOKUP tagging, reconciliation, validation, and SQL sync |
| [5. Splunk Integration](./sections/Splunk_Dashboards.md) | Real-time alerts, dashboarding, JSON logs, and auto-email triggers |
| [6. Power BI](./sections/PowerBI_Reporting.md) | Dashboard walkthrough showing CVSS spikes, SLA gaps, regional risk |
| [7. Live Auto-Run](./sections/Automation.md) | Flip the switch: showing the system running end-to-end without intervention |

## Tech Stack
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5
- SQL Server (custom CVE + vendor DB)
- Splunk Enterprise + SOAR
- Power BI dashboards
- Python (DaxForge.py, CVEGenX.py)
- Excel (Lookups, templates)

---

## Analyst Skill Areas Demonstrated
- Vendor TPRM analysis  
- Vulnerability Management (CVE tracking, SLA gaps, enrichment)  
- Data pipeline engineering  
- Real-time alerting + incident triggers  
- Outreach simulation + risk communication  
- AI-powered risk logic

## Why It Matters  
This lab replicates enterprise-grade security workflows with **no cloud dependencies or paid software**. It's built for **training, simulation, and hiring validation**. It proves mastery not through access — but through **execution**.
